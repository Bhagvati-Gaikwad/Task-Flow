## About
**Task-Flow** is a minimalist and effective task management tool built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a client-side application, meaning it runs entirely in your browser. Its primary motivation is to provide a clean, accessible interface for managing tasks without the need for a backend server or complex setup.

## Features
* **Add new tasks:** Quickly input and save new items to your list.
* **View tasks:** Display all pending and completed tasks.
* **Mark tasks complete/incomplete:** Easily toggle the status of a task.
* **Delete tasks:** Remove items permanently from the list.
* **Local Storage Persistence:** Tasks are saved directly in your browser's local storage so they remain even after refreshing or closing the page.
